### Documentation for Shopify ETL Process

This documentation outlines an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process designed to extract data from a Shopify e-commerce store, transform it for analysis purposes, and load it into a MySQL database for storage and further analysis. The process focuses on extracting products and orders data from Shopify, preparing this data for analysis, and storing the data in a structured format.

#### Prerequisites

Before starting the ETL process, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `requests`, `pandas`, `SQLAlchemy`, and `PyMySQL` libraries installed. These can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install requests pandas sqlalchemy pymysql

- Access to a Shopify store with an API key.
- Access to a MySQL database.

## Configuration


- **Shopify Access**

```python
ACCESS_TOKEN = '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'
SHOP_DOMAIN = ' myydummystore.myshopify.com'
HEADERS = {'X-Shopify-Access-Token': ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

- **MySQL Database Connection**

```python
mysql_user = 'your_mysql_user'
mysql_password = 'your_mysql_password'
mysql_host = 'your_mysql_host'
mysql_database = 'your_mysql_database'
connection_string = f"mysql+pymysql://{mysql_user}:{mysql_password}@{mysql_host}/{mysql_database}"
```

## Extraction Process

### Extracting Products Data

1. Make a GET request to the Shopify API's products endpoint.
2. Parse the JSON response to extract the products data.
3. Handle possible HTTP errors by checking the response status code.

### Extracting Orders Data

1. Make a GET request to the Shopify API's orders endpoint with a query parameter to fetch orders of any status.
2. Extract the orders data from the JSON response.

## Transformation Process

Transform the extracted data to make it suitable for analysis. This involves:

- Converting the JSON data into pandas DataFrames.
- Performing any necessary data cleaning or manipulation, such as handling missing values or converting data types.

## Loading Process

Load the transformed data into a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy:

1. Use SQLAlchemy to create a database engine.
2. Use pandas' `to_sql` method to load the data into your MySQL database.

## Code Implementation

The complete code includes functions for fetching products and orders, transforming the data, and loading it into the database. Refer to the provided code snippet for specific implementation details, including error handling and data transformation techniques.

## Final Analysis and Reporting

After loading the data into the database, perform analysis to derive insights such as total sales, total orders, and average order value. The results of this analysis are also loaded into the database for reporting purposes.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up an ETL process for extracting data from Shopify, transforming it for analysis, and loading it into a MySQL database. This process enables efficient data analysis and storage, facilitating deeper insights into the e-commerce store's performance.
